This mod adds the **Shattered Stopwatch**, an obtuse and inconvenient traversal tool:
- Use the Shattered Stopwatch to revert it to the **Ticking Stopwatch**, saving a return point at your feet.
- Use the Ticking Stopwatch to **Lap it** - returning you to the return point and leaving a "ghost".
- Collide with a ghost to **Shatter** it, launching you into the air.
- Shattered ghosts do not return when using **Lap**, forcing **Shatter Chains** to take 2^N laps to complete.
- Sneak-use the Ticking Stopwatch to **Break** it, removing your return point and reporting your laps and time.

The Shattered Stopwatch is designed as a toy for demos and custom parkour servers.<br/>
For completeness though, there is a recipe:

Have fun!
